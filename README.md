# Why did Spotify recommend that?

Have you ever listened to Spotify’s Discover Weekly playlist and wondered why a certain song was recommended to you? It happens to us quite often. We sought to find what songs we listened to in the past influenced what songs were recommended.

Spotify’s API provides a lot of information about songs, such as its energy, danceability, speechiness, acousticness. We utilized this data from the API to create a linear regression model for these factors so we could determine if songs were similar. This model was utilized in an application where any user can sign in and specify a song in order to find what they listened to that could have caused the recommendation.

## Data Collection

Song data was collected from the Spotify Web API using a Python package called [Spotipy](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy). Data was collected in two stages: pairs of non-similar songs and pairs of similar songs.

### Non-similar

Non-similar song pairs were generated by pulling 1000 random songs from Spotify and creating 500 pairs from these songs. These songs were classified as not similar.

### Similar songs

Similar song pairs were generated by pulling 1000 random songs from Spotify as we did for non-similar. However, to find a similar song, we found the top recommended song for a given song and classified that pair as similar.
